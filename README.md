ruby-rtmidi
===========

Ruby wrapper for the RtMidi C++ library

Learn more about RtMidi: http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtmidi/index.html

This will be built with Ruby FFI (https://github.com/ffi/ffi) and techniques for wrapping C++ code with C interfaces as explained at http://bicosyes.com/2012/11/create-rubyjruby-bindings-of-cc-with-ffi/

Once this is further along I intend to release this as a Ruby gem called 'rtmidi'.
